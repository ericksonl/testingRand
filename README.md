I have always been curious how random the ran.nextInt function from the Random class in the java.util package was. To test this I created a program that will generate numbers from 0-10(inclusive) and outputs the amount and overall percantage the numbers occurred. I discovered that overall it was random, with every number having around a 9.1% chance of being generated. 

# Sample output:
```
How many numbers would you like to generate?
100

Number of eights: 13
Number of nines: 13
Number of tens: 12
Total: 100

Percent zero: 11.0%
Percent one: 12.0%
Percent two: 6.0%
Percent three: 4.0%
Percent four: 10.0%
Percent five: 6.0%
Percent six: 7.000000000000001%
Percent seven: 6.0%
Percent eight: 13.0%
Percent nine: 13.0%
