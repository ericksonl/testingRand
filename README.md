I was curious how random the ran.nextInt was. To test this I created a program that will generate numbers from 0-10(inclusive) and outputs the amount of each number that was generated, as well as the percantage. I discovered that overall it was random, with every number having around a 9.1% chance of being generated. 

# Sample output:
```
How many numbers would you like to generate?
